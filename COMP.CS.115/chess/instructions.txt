Instructions for Chess Game

Overview
This project implements a chess game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt.
The game allows two players to play chess, displaying the board and pieces.
The game includes all standard chess pieces (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, king)
and their respective movement rules.

How the Code Works

1. Main Components
- 'MainWindow': The main GUI class that handles the chessboard display, user interactions, and game logic integration.
- 'Chess': The core game logic class that manages the board state, turn-taking, and move validation.
- 'ChessBoard': Represents the chessboard and manages the placement of pieces.
- 'ChessPiece': An abstract base class for all chess pieces, defining common attributes and methods.
- Piece Classes: Specific implementations for each chess piece (`Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, `King`) with their movement rules.

---

2. Game Initialization
- The game starts in 'MainWindow' by calling 'chess_.start_game()', which initializes the board with all pieces in their starting positions.
- after the game is initialized actual board in gui is initialized from GameBoard

---

3. GUI Layout
- The chessboard is an 8x8 grid of 'QPushButton' widgets, each representing a square.
- Each square displays the corresponding piece's image or remains empty if no piece is present.
- Indicators (QLabel) are placed under buttons and they are 2px bigger -> used to indicate avaible moves and selected piece

---

4. Gameplay
- Players take turns clicking on pieces and valid destination squares to make moves.
- Piece Selection:
  - Clicking on a piece highlights it in green and shows its valid moves in red.
  - If a player clicks on an invalid square, the selection resets.
  - clicking new piece (when another piece is already selected) selects it instantly 
  - if trying to select wrong color piece info label turns red and resets on new click
- Move Execution:
  - Clicking on a valid square moves the selected piece to that square.
  - Captured pieces are removed from the board.
  - Special rules like pawn promotion are handled automatically.

---

5.Rules Enforcement
- Each piece has a 'get_allowed_moves' method that calculates its valid moves based on its type and position.
- The 'Chess' class ensures that moves are valid, the correct player's turn is enforced, and the game ends when a king is captured.

---

6. Game End
- The game ends when one player's king is captured. The winner is displayed in the info label at the top of the GUI.
pieces cannot be select anymore
